SolidusLegacyStockSystem
========================

This is the old stock system. This was removed from Solidus in [this pull
request](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/2199).

What is in the box?
------------------

This extension provides the `Adjuster`, `Coordinator`, `Packer`, and
`Prioritizer` classes that were removed in version 2.4 of Solidus. Relevant
specs are also included for development and testing continued compatibility with
core.

Installation
------------

There are no migrations to go along with this extension. Following the steps
below is all that is required to use the legacy system.

Add solidus_legacy_stock_system to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_legacy_stock_system'
```

Bundle your dependencies:

```shell
bundle
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_legacy_stock_system/factories'
```
